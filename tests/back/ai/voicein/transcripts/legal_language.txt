The plaintiff alleges breach of contract and seeks damages in the amount of five hundred thousand dollars plus attorney fees and court costs. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The court must determine whether the complaint contains sufficient factual allegations to establish a plausible claim for relief. The statute of limitations for breach of contract claims is four years from the date of breach. The parties entered into a written agreement containing an arbitration clause and choice of law provision selecting Delaware law. The plaintiff claims the defendant materially breached the contract by failing to deliver conforming goods according to the specifications set forth in Exhibit A. The defendant argues that any alleged breach was excused by the doctrine of impossibility or commercial impracticability. The court will apply the mailbox rule to determine when acceptance of the contract occurred. Damages for breach of contract include expectation damages, consequential damages, and incidental damages, subject to the duty to mitigate. The contract contains a liquidated damages clause that may be enforceable if the amount represents a reasonable estimate of actual damages. Discovery will proceed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure including depositions, interrogatories, and requests for production of documents.
