The patient presents with acute myocardial infarction and requires immediate percutaneous coronary intervention. Laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, leukocytosis, and hyperlipidemia. The echocardiogram reveals left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of thirty-five percent. Medications include atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and clopidogrel. The differential diagnosis includes unstable angina, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection. Contraindications for thrombolytic therapy include recent hemorrhagic stroke and active gastrointestinal bleeding. The prognosis depends on timely revascularization and adherence to evidence-based pharmacotherapy. Comorbidities include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Post-procedural monitoring will include serial electrocardiograms, cardiac biomarkers, and hemodynamic assessment. The multidisciplinary team includes cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and interventional radiologists.
