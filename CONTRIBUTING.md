## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/personal-chatter.git
cd personal-chatter
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### 3. Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
We use automated code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format code
black .
isort .

# Lint code
ruff check .
mypy api/ services/

# Run all pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing
All contributions must include appropriate tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/
pytest tests/integration/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=api --cov=services --cov-report=html
```

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical operations
- **Security Tests**: Test for vulnerabilities

### Documentation
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Update README.md for new features
- Add type hints to all function parameters and return values

## 🏗 Architecture Guidelines

### Code Organization
```
personal-chatter/
├── api/              # FastAPI endpoints and models
├── services/         # Business logic and core services
├── tests/           # Test suite
├── docs/            # Documentation
└── legacy/          # Legacy code (being refactored)
```

### Design Principles
1. **Modularity**: Keep components loosely coupled
2. **Testability**: Write testable, dependency-injectable code
3. **Privacy**: Never log or transmit personal data
4. **Security**: Follow secure coding practices
5. **Performance**: Optimize for resource-constrained environments

### API Design
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Document all endpoints with OpenAPI
