## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 📧 Private Disclosure

**Please do NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, email us at: **security@personal-chatter.org**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if any)
- Your contact information

### 🕒 Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment of your report
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed investigation and fix development
- **14 days**: Security patch release (for high/critical issues)
- **30 days**: Public disclosure (after fix is deployed)

### 🎯 Scope

Security issues we're particularly interested in:

#### ✅ In Scope
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- SQL injection or NoSQL injection
- Authentication and authorization bypasses
- Data exposure or privacy violations
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) in web interfaces
- Insecure cryptographic implementations
- Dependency vulnerabilities with exploitable impact
- Container escape or privilege escalation
- Model poisoning or adversarial attacks
- Prompt injection attacks

#### ❌ Out of Scope
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- Denial of service (DoS) attacks
- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to maintainers)
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without practical exploitation
- Issues requiring physical access to the machine
- Self-XSS or user-initiated malicious actions
